Docker environments

In this repo, I provide several docker environments in daily usage. \
The prebuilt images also available on DockerHub.

## [dev_basic](https://hub.docker.com/r/andyhsu10/dev_basic)

Based on latest ubuntu LTS image with a bunch of development tools installed.

## [dev_basic_gpu](https://hub.docker.com/r/andyhsu10/dev_basic_gpu)

Based on latest cuda image released by nvidia, have the same tools installed as **dev_basic**.
